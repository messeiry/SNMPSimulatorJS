# snmpjs Agent API

Agents are software components that make data available to management
applications via SNMP.  They are analogous to HTTP servers.  With snmpjs, it is
as easy to implement an SNMP agent as it is to implement an HTTP server using
built-in [Node.js][] functionality.  The agent framework provides only a few
interfaces, which are described in the remainder of this document.

# createAgent(options)

This function creates and returns an Agent object.  Its sole argument, which is
optional, contains any or all of the following members:

	{
		name: [String],
		dtrace: [Object (DTraceProvider)],
		log: [Object (bunyan)]
	}

The interfaces provided by the Agent object are described in detail below.

### name

If present, the `name` member will be used to name the DTrace provider and to
decorate log output.  The default value is `'snmpjs'`.

### dtrace

If present, the agent's DTrace probes will be appended to the existing provider
referenced by the `dtrace` member.  Otherwise, a new provider identified by the
`name` member (or its default value if absent) will be created.

### log

If present, the agent will add its own child logger to the existing [Bunyan][]
logger referenced by the `log` member.  Otherwise, a new logger identified by
the `name` member (or its default value if absent) will be created.

# Agent

The Agent object, created by a call to `createAgent`, provides interfaces for
defining where the agent listens for requests and what it should do with them.
An agent will not receive any requests until it is bound to an endpoint that
generates them, and it will respond with errors to all requests if no providers
have been loaded.

## Agent.request(prov)

This method attaches one or more MIB providers to the agent, allowing it to
usefully handle requests.  The sole argument must be either a provider
descriptor as specified by the [provider API][], or an array of such objects.

## Agent.bind(endpoint, cb)

Analogous to the `dgram.bind()` method, this method causes the agent to bind a
newly-created socket to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 UDP port and begin receiving
messages.  The endpoint argument must be an object with the following members:

	{
		family: [String],
		port: [Number],
		[ addr: [String] ]
	}

The `family` member must be a string acceptable to `dgram.createSocket()`.  The
`port` member must be an integer in \[1, 65535\], and otherwise acceptable to
`dgram.bind()`.  If present, the optional `addr` member will be used to restrict
the IPv4 or IPv6 address on which the agent will receive messages; by default,
it will receive messages on all addresses of the specified address family.

If provided, the optional argument cb must be a function; it will be invoked
when the 'listening' event is emitted by the underlying socket.

This method may be called multiple times, such that it is possible to receive
incoming messages on any number of endpoints.

## Agent.close()

Analogous to the `dgram.close()` method, this method causes the agent to cease
receiving incoming requests on all previously-bound endpoints.  It takes no
arguments.
